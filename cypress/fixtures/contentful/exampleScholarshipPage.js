DoSomething members stepped up to (super) empower younger students\u2019 love of STEM with [STEM Superheroes](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/stem-superheroes-campaign) posters. DoSomething member Simone brought STEM representation to a middle school classroom and earned a scholarship in the process.  \n\n![simone](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/4GsXQ0t22iVGDM9tHSi3ZE/3ed348c14cab20e5b3204a95f19040d4/simone.jpeg)\n\n__Simone says:__\n\n> \u201cEver since I was a child, I was fascinated by the topics and issues that the STEM field covered. It seemed as though it was a never-ending horizon that stretched endlessly with new possible discoveries. STEM was not a popular subject that most of my middle school peers enjoyed which made me feel isolated and kept me from reaching my full potential at a young age. While I attended multiple STEM programs in my youth, there was only a disconnect to the field because I was afraid of being isolated from my peers. This campaign is crucial for young students of color to establish diversity in STEM careers. The result of enthusing young students into the STEM field early will allow companies to create more spaces for underrepresented groups.\u201d\n> \n\n### Olivia\n\nIt takes five positive statements to cancel the impact of one negative one.That\u2019s why DoSomething members like Olivia posted 21,649 positive affirmation tearsheets in schools nationwide to [Cancel Bullying](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/cancel-bullying). Olivia earned a scholarship for her help spreading good vibes at her school. \n\n![olivia](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/5Dgx7EZyPIuxIcvximjZ5R/fd4e2db1c597af394e6320861492b693/olivia.jpg)\n\n__Olivia says:__\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m so surprised and thankful I won a $500 scholarship from DoSomething.org. I will gratefully appreciate this scholarship. This campaign is important to me because it will help me achieve my dreams of furthering my education into becoming an Art Therapist or a Midwife.

Through our [NSFW (Not Safe For Wheels)](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/not-safe-for-wheels) campaign, Allie joined 18,377 other DoSomething members in sharing tips to keep her loved ones safe on the road (and it earned her a $2,500 scholarship!). \n\n![Allison Dempsey - IMG 1708](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/1YdSU7B3cJumGyOedL93HO/94b1b710b47d7ee20a8d01f3d187081c/Allison_Dempsey_-_IMG_1708.jpg)\n\n__Allie says:__\n\n> \u201cDo Something\u2019s campaign NSFW (NOT SAFE FOR WHEELS) is important to me because although I have not personally lost someone due to distracted driving, I have had family members and friends get into small accidents because of it. One of my biggest fears is to get a call that I lost a loved one due to distracted driving...I want to take an active approach to distracted driving. For young adults, the primary distraction is our mobile devices. In my own car, my phone goes into my cupholder and doesn\u2019t come out till I have stopped driving...Not having a screen on while driving would save countless lives.\u201d\n> \n\n### Cesar\n\nWe know that it takes five positive statements to cancel out one negative one, so our [Cancel Bullying](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/cancel-bullying) campaign set out to cancel the effects of bullying with the power of good vibes. Thanks to DoSomething members like Cesar, 21,649 positive affirmation tear sheets have been posted in schools across the country. Cesar helped keep his classmates smiling and earned a $5,000 scholarship in the process.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-12-06 at 11.37.37 AM](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/3i57doWMNNSVFzzqC31UaP/cfe30e6229b72b3d8f20d3fbc41d53ad/Screen_Shot_2019-12-06_at_11.37.37_AM.png)\n\n__Cesar says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign is important to me because I felt the need to spread awareness about bullying and that it should be stopped at schools. Many people are bullied everyday at school where they go to learn. They shouldn\u2019t fear going to school due to the fact that they know that once they get there they will be mistreated and bullied. That\u2019s why we should all stand up to bullying and get rid of it everywhere so we can all be in peace.\u201d\n> \n\n### Dina\n\nBeing in the hospital as a kid can feel kind of scary (and almost 3 million kids experience it every year). That\u2019s why DoSomething members made thousands of DIY activity books for kids in hospitals through our [Huddle Up to Brighten Someone\u2019s Day](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/huddle-brighten-someone-day) campaign. Dina earned a $5,000 scholarship for her help unleashing the power of play. \n\n![Dina Abrahim - EDD5377B-9DA2-43D7-81B1-D65A79D7507A](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/3BiKVVmEGsf6svH0cqZAH6/619439e3480b427bbed49d06f5f63f05/Dina_Abrahim_-_EDD5377B-9DA2-43D7-81B1-D65A79D7507A.jpeg)\n\n__Dina says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign is important to me because I believe that all kids, especially kids in hospitals, should be able to take a moment to forget about their problems and just have fun. I made the activity book with the hope that it would help some kid in a hospital have fun and forget about their problems for a little while.\u201d\n>\n\n### Makayla\n\nOnly 16% of scientists and engineers in the US are women, people of color, or people with disabilities. These groups deserve to see themselves represented in STEM, and DoSomething members used [STEM Superheroes](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/stem-superheroes-campaign) posters to inspire younger students love for science, technology, engineering, and math. Makayla gave STEM Superheroes presentations to middle school classes, empowering them to pursue STEM and earning her a $2,500 scholarship.  \n\n![Makayla Whittenburg - Photo](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/1rFRxuy5FR92xbohxjf0Gi/4e7e968788251313c1b38d2eb07c089e/Makayla_Whittenburg_-_Photo.jpg)\n\n__Makayla says:__\n\n> \u201cSharing and spreading awareness to STEM is so important in today's society. STEM can be found in almost every single thing that makes up the world. If we spread the importance and benefits of STEM to children at an early age, our schools, communities, states, and nation will reap the positive effects. When I asked the children I was teaching what they wanted to be when they grew up, many wanted to enter into a STEM related job, and even more of them wanted to after I followed and taught the superhero lesson plan. What touched my heart even more was how many minority groups I got to share this campaign with. The more we empower these kiddos, the stronger our STEM society will be!\u201d\n>",

              "# October 2019 Scholarship Winners\n\n### Janet\n\nDoSomething members helped their friends and family be more responsible travelers this summer by sharing 17,343 guides through the [Green Your Getaway campaign](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/green-your-getaway). Janet earned a $5,000 scholarship for spreading the word about sustainable travel by sharing our guide.\n\n![Janet](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/665JZ85CQfFvzPnSVDJMAK/be2b51db81ad8aefcc383559281b7a19/Janet.jpg)\n\n__Janet says:__\n\n> \"This campaign is important to me because sustainability is something that we should all try to achieve in every aspect of our life ESPECIALLY when it comes to travel. Being sustainable doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t visit family or explore the world...as long as we\u2019re smart about it. We might not have the same environmental impact as giant corporations, but we have an obligation to our planet to treat it with respect and seemingly tiny actions can have far reaching effects when compounded by the power of billions of people. The goal should be to leave a better world than we had for future generations to come.\"\n> \n\n### Chase\n\nAcross the country, DoSomething members created greener and cleaner places in their communities through by cleaning up 249,228 pieces of trash through the [Huddle Up to Play It Forward](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/play-it-forward) campaign. Chase saw a problem with litter in his town and decided to do something about it, scoring a $2,500 scholarship in the process.\n\n![ChaseH](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/2Jr90eI8tlo7P3wPfFC7wn/f28b87743f93fa3cd9cf3f08e801b182/ChaseH.png)\n\n__Chase says:__\n\n> \u201cI come from a little-known town in Oregon called Eagle Point. Oridinarily when someone hears about Oregon, people like to think of Portland, Salem and Eugene, and often forget about all of the little towns and neat histories within those small cities. Growing up in a small town, it\u2019s sad to me to see the rampant increase over the last few years of trash, garbage, refuse, and litter all across the Rogue Valley from Ashland to Shady Cove. I will sometimes try to go to the mall with my friends, but be greeted by the piles of trash from Bear Creek, or the abandoned construction zone in Central Point. So, after hearing about the campaign, I decided I would clean up one of the most important places to me: my office. I work for a successful plumbing company in Southern Oregon, and my office is the outdoors. I drive all over every single day to go help people with whatever problems they may have. Plumbing, Leak Detection, Renovation, I help do it all. Near the Headquarters of the company is a massive, abandoned lot that used to hold a few buildings that were demolished. All the concrete and iron had been removed, but a lot of insulation and PVC pipe had been left to just sit out in the weather. After hearing about the Do Something campaign, I decided to DO SOMETHING and I decided to actually clean up the lot that had been bugging me for quite some time. I got a little help from my dad in procuring  a dumpster, and spent the rest of the day cleaning up the entire area of pizza boxes, old plumbing bits and pieces, and even an entire toilet that had been shattered. After a long day of work, I was proud to have contributed to my co-workers and my community by fixing a problem that nobody else seemed to care about.\u201d\n> \n\n### Gabrielle\n\nAbout 3 out of 5 teens have been bullied or harassed online, largely on social media platforms. DoSomething members took it upon themselves to flag 65,017 cyberbullying posts through the [Shred Hate](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/shred-hate-2019) -- including Gabrielle! She chose kindness, flagged bullying, and earned a $5,000 scholarship.\n\n![Gabrielle](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/YrAYsOUow2Flq5Io9yka9/4b770458a1c002814049349d3357d4a5/Gabrielle.jpeg)\n\n__Gabrielle says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign was significant to me because I think it is important to make a positive, rather than a negative impact online. In modern society we often let people hide behind screens and face no repercussions for the hate they put out into the world. We should be using social media to spread positive messages and should no longer be afraid to stand up to online hate.\u201d\n>\n\n### Maria\n\nThrough our [STEM Superheroes](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/stem-superheroes) poster contest, we put out a call for original superheroes to inspire and empower young students (and show them that STEM can save the world!). DoSomething member Maria earned a $5,000 scholarship for her winning design: Dr. Sproutfast, a Nigerian-American botanist and climate hero. Maria\u2019s Dr. Sproutfast design was also sent to 5,000 schools around the country!\n\n![mariastem](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/1AsNIL6kF8yW09YL9I8kdt/ddaa087169bc9fa93429f03f2396fbf7/mariastem.jpg)\n\n__Maria says:__\n\n> \u201cPart of it has to do with my upbringing: as a disabled Latina, the homogeny in the STEM field can be kind of daunting. I'm fortunate to live in Miami, where the diversity is much higher than in other regions, and where scientists come from all shades and backgrounds. I want to show other budding scientists that there's no challenge dedication and patience can't overcome. It starts with representation; seeing someone that looks like you, doing what you do, can cause a spark of inspiration that lasts a lifetime. That's how it happened with me, at least. Marina Ngozi is Nigerian-America, and she's an original character I've been thinking about for a long time. She's my image of the Scientist Hero: someone who has a skill and will stop at nothing to share it, easing the suffering of others and of even the planet itself. It's an honest coincidence that she fits the demographic bill for this contest, though I think it's quite telling: my image of the Scientist Hero was already a strong, empathetic woman of color to begin with. :) !!\u201d\n> \n\n### Marissa\n\nStudent loan debt affects a lot of people -- as many as 44.7 million Americans have it. 59,062 DoSomething members shared their thoughts on student loan debt to compel employers to [Invest In Us](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/company-student-debt) and address the debt crisis. DoSomething member Marissa earned a $2,500 scholarship for adding her voice to this important conversation. \n\n![marissa](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/1jfyzl3YUtv8myNM8yWGM9/75547449fe29c344a294cb6d02b3ad11/marissa.jpeg)\n\n__Marissa says:__\n\n> \u201cFor me, the DoSomething campaign means giving hardworking students the opportunity to be successful in their college life by sponsoring and furthering their education. It shows young adults that by giving back to their community they can also receive some benefits. I chose to participate in the campaign because I like what DoSomething stands for. This campaign is very important to me because it is going to help me financially on my journey in Respiratory Therapy school and I know that it will continue to help other students looking to achieve their goals as well!\u201d\n> \n\n### Samantha\n\nOver 50 billion pieces of litter land on roads and in waterways each year. DoSomething member Samantha decided to [Huddle Up to Play It Forward](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/play-it-forward), joining our national clean-up campaign and earning herself a $2,500 scholarship for taking care of her community.\n\n![samantha](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/3Wkk8qGgumF6JluJKAIGXp/e68b808fd1a529885ccf9cb89b21b4e9/samantha.jpeg)\n\n__Samantha says:__\n\n> \u201cWhen first looking into scholarship opportunities that were available to me, I had found this campaign and really took an interest in it. I realized how important it was to me because as a woman who is a Christian, I saw a fantastic opportunity to serve and help to make a difference in the world we live in. As Christians, we are called to serve. I also find myself to be very passionate about others and how I can help in any way I can even if it is a small way. This campaign allowed for me to take more steps in being a faithful steward of others in small, but meaningful ways. I truly enjoyed being able to participate!\u201d\n> \n\n### Andrea\n\nDoSomething member Andrea got to put the sustainable travel tips from [Green Your Getaway](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/green-your-getaway) into practice when she visited Cambodia. By sharing the sustainable travel guide, Andrea helped others do the same and earned a $5,000 scholarship.\n\n![andrea](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/12RtogLypS2C6FYqgFelyX/b4d433d5e98c999c5d83e64ca7338a13/andrea.jpeg)\n\n__Andrea says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign caught my eye very quickly because it was something I could relate to. This summer, I got the amazing opportunity to travel to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. There were so many cultural and traveling knowledge I gained while in Cambodia. When I read the Green Getaway Campaign provided by Do Something, I agreed with all 8 ways to travel this summer. The 8 ways Do Something provided were: pack lightly, wear natural fibers, check labels and ingredients, bring reusable bags, reduce your water use, travel locally and by land when you can, support local economy, and respect natural and cultural sites. The most important guides for Cambodia were to pack lightly, travel locally, support local economy, and to respect natural and cultural sites. We were limited to only one suitcase and it was a two week long trip. I had learned from youtube videos to roll your clothes but I wanted to be more effective, so I packed only the bare essentials for the trip. This strategy helped me by the end of the trip because I was able to fit souvenirs in the space I had left in my luggage. Supporting local economy was my favorite part of the trip.\u201d\n> \n\n### Derby\n\nProm is supposed to be magical and memorable, but for many students it\u2019s just...stressful. That\u2019s why we created the first-ever [Prom Anxiety Textline](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/prom-anxiety-textline-2019). Derby posted flyers for the textline to help her friends stay stress-free, and she earned a $2,500 scholarship!\n\n![derbycover](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/7cogGr9Rrwkrmyp8qdo72J/79c81940752538b47872b4dbeff6e778/derbycover.jpg)\n\n__Derby says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign was important to me because I was so stressed about prom and it did not help having a group chat with my friends. As we spoke about our nails but not our dress just cause were waiting for the big reveal. So I felt I had to make sure I looked amazing when the day came. When the day did come though I realized getting ready for prom should have been stress free and I should have enjoyed the process of it more. I feel other girls should know that.\u201d\n> ",

To participate and give my small part, my own words are privilege enough, and I can only hope that someone is emboldened and encouraged by my words, or even consider a change of heart.\u201d\n> \n\n### Kiah\n\nThe summer can mean trouble for the over 30 million students who rely on their school for free or reduced-price lunches. That\u2019s why DoSomething member Kiah joined the movement to collect items for the [Huddle Against Hunger](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/huddle-against-hunger?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship), our national youth-led food drive.

The more people resolved with combating this problem, the greater chance for more people to be relieved from this burden and prevent the same problem from passing over to someone else.\u201d\n> \n\n### Elizabeth\n\nIn light of the dramatic rise in hate crimes towards Muslim Americans since 2015, thousands of young people led an outpouring of support to Muslims in their communities. Elizabeth believes everyone should be able to enjoy their holidays with love and support, so she joined the [Sincerely, Us](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/sincerely-us/community?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship) campaign in making cards celebrating Eid al-Fitr, one of the biggest Muslim holidays.

              "# May 2019 Scholarship Winners\n\n### Whitney\n\nOn any day in America, over 138,000 teenagers and children may finish school and return to a shelter instead of a home. Whitney joined thousands of DoSomething members who donated over 60,000 bags of daily essential items to shelters across the country through [Supplies, Sealed, Delivered](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/supplies-sealed-delivered/community?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship).

As my high school\u2019s Math Club President my senior year of high school, I knew I needed to help the homeless shelter once more. We gathered cleaning supplies, plastic bags, cereal, socks, tissues, and many other things. For myself, imagining not having clean socks, food to eat, or even something to blow my nose in, is something I will hopefully never have to face. Because of this, I want others who are having these trials in their lives to be fortunate enough to have these small but meaningful items. Many people take these daily fortunes for granted, but I know that anything and everything that is donated to our homeless shelter is greatly appreciated and used to full capacity.\u201d\n> \n\n### Quasjay\n\nEveryone deserves the chance to go to prom, but for some students it\u2019s too expensive to afford. Quasjay knows that a prom outfit can be a big expense, so she donated formal wear through [Take Back the Prom: Outfit Donations](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/prom-for-all/action?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship) and earned a well-deserved scholarship!\n\n![image1-2](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/5qJIpT1Ar5sBtcBkmFU4AP/49ab016106250f42328101050a2fb7aa/image1-2.jpeg)\n\n__Quasjay says:__\n\n> \u201cThis campaign is important to me because prom is a big thing.

In order to combat this growing problem, I believe it is important to educate those around us by showing them how to identify credible sources and sites. Helping others can start even in one's own home, by educating siblings or parents, which is what I decided to do. Although I started small, and was only able to help those immediately around me, they can now do the same and spread the message further. By teaching those around us, we can encourage critical thinking and the desire to find the accuracy of the information around us.\u201d\n>",

I am also utterly grateful to have received this scholarship because I have no financial support from any sources besides scholarships and financial aid.\u201d\n\n### Piper\n\nSince 2012, there have been over 1,500 mass shootings in the United States. DoSomething member Piper decided enough was enough. By registering to vote, taking our gun law quiz, and sharing her thoughts on gun violence prevention with her elected officials, Piper showed it\u2019s time to [Do Something About Gun Violence](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/do-something-about-gun-violence/action?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship) and earned a scholarship for stepping up.  \n\n![Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 3.11.47 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/MXAMJ69RRSxssf3P1C8QY/30dc52c469f53ce4173e6f3fbd0a5f01/Screen_Shot_2019-04-18_at_3.11.47_PM.png)\n\n__Piper says:__ \n\n> \u201cI believe this campaign on gun violence is important because our security has not improved enough to where everyone can go out in public and feel safe. Mass shootings are still a recurring issue that will only get worse if the government does not do something about the usage of guns. This campaign will ensure the safety of millions of people, including my loved ones.\u201d\n\n### Ricardo\n\nIn 2018, the United States averaged at least [one deadly mass shooting per month](https://abcnews.go.com/US/2018-mass-shooting-month-us/story?id=59418185), with over 300 incidents reported by the end of the year. DoSomething member and scholarship winner Ricardo shared his thoughts on safe gun violence prevention methods, which were sent directly to members of Congress through the [Do Something About Gun Violence](https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/do-something-about-gun-violence/action?source=email&utm_source=dosomething&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ds_scholarship) campaign. \n\n![ricardo ds gvp](//images.ctfassets.net/81iqaqpfd8fy/1t8Oi61UunE74zS7rbjxGT/0513f1dcebe1f5f3ebacc6d8b9d95a69/ricardo_ds_gvp.jpg)\n\n__Ricardo says:__ \n\n> \u201cGun violence across the country has devastated hundreds of families. Whichever choice the nation comes to, we need to acknowledge that many cases involving gun violence involve mental health. We are living at a time where more and more people are suffering from mental health issues that aren\u2019t as obvious or visible at first. I believe mental health awareness and help is a good first step in preventing gun violence and moving forward to a peaceful solution to gun violence.\u201d\n\n### Darren\n\nDoSomething member Darren knows that high school can be overwhelming but isn\u2019t about to let stress get in the way of following his passions.

Prom should be for everyone, but some students aren\u2019t able to splurge on a new dress or suit. DoSomething member Ricardo is ready to take back the prom!

I was so happy to be able to give someone the opportunity to experience one of the biggest highlights of high school.

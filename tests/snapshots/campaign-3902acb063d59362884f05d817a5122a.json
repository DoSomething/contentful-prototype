We'll take 'em.\n\n### Where and when do I drop off the jeans I collect?\nDrop off the jeans you collect at the closest local partner shelter accepting jeans from February 1 to February 29, 2016. You can find your closest shelter by clicking the Locate button under the Stuff You Need section or using this link directly: [bit.ly\/1PeHdZ0](http:\/\/bit.ly\/1PeHdZ0).\n\n### Can I donate other items of clothing?\nTeens for Jeans only collects jeans, but other types of clothing are generally helpful for people experiencing homelessness. Call the partner shelter, explain that you are working on the Teens for Jeans campaign, and ask if they would accept your other articles of clothing.\n\n### What size jeans can I donate?\nFeel free to donate any and all sizes! As a note, larger sizes are typically very helpful for shelters.\n\n### Can I hold a drive at my religious center or with my youth group?\nTotally! The drive at your religious center can function just like a school drive, but because of the way the rules are written, only schools are eligible for the grants.sldkjfalskdjfh;asldjkfa;sldkjf\n"

Oil is found deep underground and we have to drill into the Earth to get it out. Sometimes things go wrong, and toxic oil is spilled in huge amounts, killing wildlife and destroying natural habitats. Also, a lot of our oil comes from other countries, so relying on them for something that powers our whole country affects our national security. These are just a few reasons why we should all try to use less oil.\n\n#### How can I create my own campaign like Cassandra did??\nHave a unique idea for a way young people around the country can impact on an important issue? Fill out [this form](https:\/\/www.dosomething.org\/campaigns\/submit-your-idea) and if we think it sounds like a DoSomething.org campaign, we'll hit you up!"

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <h4>1. Who can I refer?</h4>
          <p>
            Earn your reward for referring NEW members to DoSomething!
            Unfortunately, if you refer someone that already has a DoSomething
            account, you wonâ€™t get the reward when they sign up for the shared
            campaign.
          </p>
          <h4>2. How will I know if I won the scholarship?</h4>
          <p>
            We will email you using the same email address used to create your
            DoSomething account. Scholarship winners are announced when the
            campaign closes.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Where can I find the full rules?</h4>

        <h4>1. Who can I refer?</h4>

        <p>
          Earn your reward for referring NEW members to DoSomething!
          Unfortunately, if you refer someone that already has a DoSomething
          account, you wonâ€™t get the reward when they sign up for the shared
          campaign.
        </p>

        <h4>2. How will I know if I won the scholarship?</h4>

        <p>
          We will email you using the same email address used to create your
          DoSomething account. Scholarship winners are announced when the
          campaign closes.
        </p>

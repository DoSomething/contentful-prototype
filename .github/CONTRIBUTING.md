# Contributing


We follow [Laravel's code style](http://laravel.com/docs/5.3/contributions#coding-style). Be sure to configure
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) to ensure you have proper indentation settings.

Consider [writing a test case](http://laravel.com/docs/5.3/testing) when adding or changing a feature.
Most steps you would take when manually testing your code can be automated, which makes it easier for
yourself & others to review your code and ensures we don't accidentally break something later on!

@TODO Need to flesh this out a bit more!

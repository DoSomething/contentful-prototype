# Getting Started

The documentation for Phoenix \(next\) is generated from the `/docs` directory in the Phoenix repository using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

You can contribute to editing this documentation either by editing the `/docs` files locally and submitting a pull request or by editing the files on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and using their interface to submit a pull request.

So that GitBook generates the documentation properly and converts the markdown to HTML, you need to always ensure that with every new page you add, you include a corresponding entry to the `/docs/SUMMARY.md` file.

Additionally, all links in a file are relative to that file's location in the directory structure.

# Articles Page

## Overview

This content type is an in-house replacement for the page we formerly housed on Instapage. It features articles from our site on a variety of topics.

## Content Type Fields

-   **Header Title**: Custom Title for the featured header article (alternative to headline in article page itself).

-   **Header Button Text**: Optional custom text for the link out to the header article.

## Technical Notes

Page entries are the currently the only type of entry we are validating for in the galleries since this is an articles specific page.

## Additional Information

We chose to define each block of articles explicitly vs a rich text content field because of clarity for editors and being able to work in a stand alone component on the page itself.

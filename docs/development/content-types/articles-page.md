## Technical Notes

Page entries are the currently the only type of entry we are validating for in the galleries since this is an articles specific page.

## Additional Information

We chose to define each block of articles explicitly vs a rich text content field because of clarity for editors and being able to work in a stand alone component on the page itself.

# Voter Registration Referrals Block

This block type displays the current user's completed voter registration referrals, as well as voter registration referrals that are still in progress.

![Voter Registration Referrals Block](../../.gitbook/assets/voter-registration-referrals-block.png)

**Note:** It will display the user's voter registration referrals for all voter registration actions -- but we only began saving referrer users on `voter-reg` posts in 2020 for [action 954](https://activity.dosomething.org/actions/954).

## Fields

-   **Internal Title**

-   **Title**: Optional `SectionHeader` text, e.g. "Get 3 friends to register!"

## Notes

All block content besides the `title` field is managed in code, e.g. "You have registered **1 person** so far.".

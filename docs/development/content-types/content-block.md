# Content Block

## Overview

A Page block displaying headline, subtitle, supertitle, copy, and image. Commonly used to list steps in a campaign.

A `ContentBlock` may also display a [School Finder via its additionalContent field](development/features/school-finder.md). This is likely temporary if we use this for multiple campaigns, as a new content type would be better for the long-term.

## Technical Notes

Available as a `ContentBlock` in GraphQL.

We use Papertrail to help manage and analyze logs from Phoenix.

You can access the Papertrail account for each Phoenix environment by heading to the [Phoenix Heroku Pipeline](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/815f2dc1-dcee-43c9-9458-f22d7e9f403f), selecting an environment and then clicking on the **Resource** tab and clicking on the **Papertrail** resource.

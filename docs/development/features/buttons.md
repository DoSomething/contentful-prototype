# Buttons

## Overview

There are currently two "core" button components and the rest of the more specialized button components extend upon these core buttons.

The two core button components are:

- [LinkButton](./linkbutton) \(renders a basic anchor link element `<a>` that looks like a button\)
- [ElementButton](./elementbutton) \(renders a basic button element `<button>`\)

Some of the specialized buttons that extend from the above core button components are:

- [PrimaryButton]()
- [SecondaryButton]()
- [ToggleButton]()

We'll review what makes each different and how to use them in the following section.

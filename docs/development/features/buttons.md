# Buttons

## Overview

There are currently two "core" button components and the rest of the more specialized button components extend upon these core buttons.

The two core button components are:

- `LinkButton` (renders an anchor link element `<a>` that looks like a button)
- `ElementButton` (renders a button element `<button>`)

Some of the specialized buttons that extend from the above core button components are:

- `PrimaryButton`
- `SecondaryButton`
- `ToggleButton`

We'll review what makes each different and how to use them in the following section.

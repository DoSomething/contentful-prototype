# Prerequisite

## DoSomething Account

You should have a DoSomething.org account and request admin access so you can log in and access Aurora, our Admin platform. You will need access to this platform so you can retrieve OAuth credentials.

## Laravel Homestead

Before getting started, you should have [Homestead](https://github.com/DoSomething/communal-docs/tree/master/Homestead) installed and set up on your computer. Homestead is a pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides a development environment to help get you up and running quickly!

## Contentful

Additionally, we use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as our content management platform. Before proceeding with the installation step, please request access to Contentful and setup an account to be able to access the _Phoenix_ space used for this project, as well accessing the necessary environment variables needed for Phoenix to properly load in your local browser.

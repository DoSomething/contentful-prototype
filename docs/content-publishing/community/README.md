# Community

The **Community Feed** provides a place where campaign leads can provide updates and other relevant information regarding the campaign. The tech team is working to expand the types of information that a lead can provide and the features available.

**Notice:** Historically, the Community Feed was updated via the 'Activity Feed' field on Campaigns in Contentful. This has been changed to simply creating/updating a standalone 'community' [page](../pages/) on a campaign.

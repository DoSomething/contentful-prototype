5. *Internal Title:* This is the main title that you will see in contentful.
  1. Format: CampaignName_UpdateNumber_ShortDesc
  2. *Display Options:* This refers to how wide you want the block to be - recommended width for campaign updates is two-thirds and full
6. *Content:* Use markdown to fill in and format whatever you want
7. *Link:* If you want the campaign update to have an external link that is highlighted in it's own card, you should put the link in this field. This is also where you should drop a YouTube link for a video update. 


## Notes on Campaign Update:
1. If you write a campaign update that is 140 characters or less, it will be styled like a Tweet. The above screenshot is what the styled Tweet looks like w/ a highlighted, external link.
2.. You can always link to external links in your markdown by using the link button  on the content editor and it'll show up like a regular link - there's just the option to highlight an external link in a card using the Link field.
- You can only highlight one external resource with this Link field per campaign update
3. You can add emojis anywhere! If you're on a Mac, click Control + Command + Space Bar (one after another) and a window w/ emojis will appear for you to select from
9. Author
    1. For the Author, you will need to create yourself as an author once, so check the "Link an existing entry" first to make sure you have not been created as an author as of yet.
    2. If the lead you want is in "Link an existing entry", great! Selecting from this list adds them as the Author. 
    3. If the lead you are looking for is not, click "Create new entry and link".

# Pages

The **Page** content type is multi-purpose and can be used to create various types of content pages on the website.

The philosophy behind Pages is that they exist as an amalgamation of rows of blocks pieced together to create a cohesive whole. They can be utilized to create pages for a campaign (Campaign Page), or to create general independent content pages (General Content Page).

The following sections provide information on setting up a variety of page types.

3.  fill in the "Title" field with `Action` _This text will appear in the tab navigation bar of the campaign_
4.  fill in the "Slug" field with `[campaign-slug]/action` _you can copy the campaign slug from the `Slug` field of the parent campaign_ (e.g. grab-mic/action)

# Adding an FAQ or Scholarship Page

1) Open your Campaign in Contentful.

2) Find the section called **Pages**.

3) Open the Page that you want to be referring to as a modal within your Campaign.

4) When the page is opened, the URL will contain the Contentful ID. In the example below, `52mLWF8lbO06q8ouuSUEkg` is the Contentful ID:
```
https://app.contentful.com/spaces/81iqaqpfd8fy/entries/52mLWF8lbO06q8ouuSUEkg
```

5) Use this Contentful ID as a reference for the URL in the Action Step or Page that you would like this page to display as a modal, with this URL structure.
```  
/us/campaigns/campaign_name/modal/contentful_id
```

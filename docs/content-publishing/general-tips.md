# General Tips

* If you go to Contentful and you see that it's trying to load with the message "Initializing reference editor," just refresh and it should go away.
* When you hit _Publish_, it takes a little bit for the changes to show up on the campaign page, but don't worry, it will!
* If you're adding a new **Action Step** or **Page**, you need to always _Publish_ those changes before returning to your main campaign page.
* To preview your campaign before publishing it, you can use the _Preview_ environment and append the slug name for your campaign at the following URL: `preview-phoenix.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/your-campaign-slug-here`.
* **Uploading Media (PDFs):** For the time being, upload media to Phoenix-ashes as you normally would and then link to those PDFs.

# General Tips
***

- If you go to Contentful and you see that it's trying to load with the message "Initializing reference editor," just refresh and it should go away!

- When you hit Publish, it takes a little bit for the changes to show up on the campaign page, but don't worry, it will!

- If you're adding a new Action Step or Page, you need to always Publish those changes before returning to your main campaign page!

- For now, to preview your campaign page, you will need to publish your campaign page in Contentful. This isn't a problem because it will publish on the URL next.dosomething.org and as long as we aren't promoting the URL, no one should have it! We have a post-launch plan to make this process better.

- **Uploading Media (PDFs):** For the time being, upload media to Phoenix-ashes as you normally would and then link to those PDFs.

# Campaign Settings

To customize some options on a campaign, you can utilize a **Campaign Settings** item by creating an entry for the campaign.

Create a new entry in the campaign for **Campaign Settings**.

If **Allow Sixpack A/B Test Experiments** field is checked in the campaign settings, we will run any experiment that is currently going on your campaign \(please check with Ashley to understand if anything is running before ticking this option\).

The **Action Text** field is an override of the text of the main CTA buttons on the campaign. This will apply to all signup buttons _if there is not an override in the CTA block already for specific buttons._ This will always override the lede and footer CTA buttons.

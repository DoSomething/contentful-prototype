# Adding Campaign Settings

1.  Create a new entry for Campaign settings.

2.  If **Allow Sixpack A/B Test Experiments** is checked, we will run any experiment that is currently going on your campaign (please check with Ashley to understand if anything is running before ticking this option).

3.  Action text is an override of the text of the main CTA buttons on the campaign. This will apply to all signup buttons *if there is not an override in the CTA block already for specific buttons. *This will always override the lede and footer CTA buttons.

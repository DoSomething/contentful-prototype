# Landing Page

To add a Landing page to a Campaign, find the field called **Landing Page** at the bottom of the Campaign page:

![Landing Page](../../.gitbook/assets/landing-page-field.png)

Within the Landing Page entry, some of the initial fields include:

* **Internal Title** should be: "Campaign Name Year-Month Pitch Page.
* **Title** should match the lede banner title.
* **Slug** should match the slug of the campaign.

"The Problem" and "The Solution" content should go into the **Content** markdown field:

![Problem/Solution](../../.gitbook/assets/landing-page-content-field.png)

The "What You Get" content is attached as a entry to the **Sidebar** field. Click "Create new entry and link" beneath the **Sidebar** field:

![What you get](../../.gitbook/assets/what-you-get-sidebar-field.png)

Give the "What You Get" entry an **Internal Title**, a published **Title**, and make it a `static` **Block Type** with `one-third` for the **Display Options**:

![What you get data](../../.gitbook/assets/what-you-get-data.png)

Add in the new content into the **Content** field, with whatever markdown needed.

Click "Publish” to publish the "What You Get" content and head back to the Landing Page content editing.

Click "Publish" on the Landing Page entry. Once the Campaign is published as well, you should be able to see the Landing Page when heading to the campaign's URL:

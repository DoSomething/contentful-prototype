# Markdown Editing Guide
When you're adding or editing content on a page or block in Contentful, you're actually writing a light markup language called Markdown. It's  plain text formatting language designed to be converted to HTML. When you hit save, the Markdown you type will be converted to HTML friendly code and displayed on the page. Using Markdown allows us to maintain readable content and blocks while providing us with the benefits of rich text formatting like headers, lists, italics and more.

Contentful uses what's called [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and can be either typed directly or accessed through the text editor interface. You can find the syntax rules at the link above. Below we've provided a set of guidelines for how to best use Markdown to format content in a way that's consistent with our design system. 

## Absolutes
These are rules to absolutely follow and never ever break. Luke will be very upset, because he has a psychic sense that alerts him when one of these rules is broken.

- Do not mix markdown `#` headers and other alterations like italics or bolding
- Do not bold more than a single sentence at a time.

## Generally
Very few things in typography and layout design are absoulte, but there are a number of things are generally accepted pracitces that might be broken if you have a good reason. If you want to break these rules, you might want to check with Luke first. 

- Work your way down the header elements one at a time like an outline. Don't jump from `#` to `####` directly.
- Do not stack headers without content between them.
- Don't use bolding for titles when you could use a header element
- Italicize to emphasize specific words and captions. 
- If you have a Q&A or repetitive type content, use fourth level (`####`) headers for each item.
- Do not bold or italicize the contents of a list item.
- Donâ€™t place a photo directly after a title element.
- Captions work best below a photo, not above

## Rules of Thumb
As you create more and more pages you'll begin to get a feel for how a page should be structured to achieve a pleasing reading experience. Until you reach this comfort level you can use some of these rules of thumb to help guide you. More philosophy than rule, these are things that are helpful to keep in mind when writing content and styling it.

### How to Choose Header Sizes
The less content you have between titles, the smaller the title should be. For instance, if you have small paragraphs with headings, you would want to use third (`###`) or fourth (`####`) level headers since larger headers would break up the reading flow too much.

### Drawing Attention
The more bolding or italic you use, the less effective it becomes in drawing attention. Think about the texture of the overall content. What pieces are going to rise up and draw attention? Headers already have a premium on size and weight, so too much extra attunement turns a paragraph into a mess.

### Add More Space
Don't be afraid to use line breaks and new paragraphs to even out the flow of your content. If your content is looking too cluttered by bold headings you can try to use plain text with more line breaks. 


### The Eyes Have It
A simple trick for feeling out your content's flow is to let your eyes relax and blur a little bit. How does the content look? Are your eyes easliy able to distinguish different levels of importance?

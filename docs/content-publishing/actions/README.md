# Actions

We want to provide DoSomething.org members with multiple actions they can decide to do in a campaign that tackles a cause they care about. This section contains a list of the actions a member can take.

Actions are typically found on the **Action Page**. Please refer to the [instructions](../pages/page-creation.md) on how to create an Action Page for a campaign to add actions to it.

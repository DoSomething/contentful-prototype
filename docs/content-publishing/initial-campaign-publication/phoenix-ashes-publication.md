# Phoenix-ashes publication
*** 

There are some fields that you need to fill in on the Phoenix-ashes campaign page because the homepage tile, the /campaigns page tiles, Looker data, and some SMS and email messaging relies on the Phoenix-ashes campaign page.

1. Create campaign page on Drupal w/ the Campaign Name.
2. **These are the fields you need to fill in with correct information:**
    - Title
    - CTA
    - Problem Statement
    - Header and square image - these should match the image you use on Phoenix-next!
    - Reportback Noun
    - Reportback Verb
    - Reportback Confirmation Message
    - Taxonomy & Discovery section
        + Make sure to check staff pick if it needs the label! All Sponsored and incentivized campaigns should have the Staff Pick label.
    - Scholarship Amount
        + Any fields that Phoenix-ashes requires you to fill in in order to save the page
        + All Impact Sheets need to be added to the Phoenix-ashes campaign page before a campaign is published please add it to the Phoenix-ashes campaign page. We don't have a spot to house these in Contentful yet.
2. Save
3. Create and attach a Campaign Run as you normally would to the Campaign. You don't need to publish the Campaign Run yet!
4. Don't publish the campaign or run yet - this will be the very last thing you do in this entire process.

4. Fill in:
5. **Title:** Should match the corresponding Ashes campaign name.

   * Slug for Phoenix: `/sincerely-us`
7. **Legacy ID:** This should be the legacy Campaign ID on Ashes.
   * For example on Ashes, Teens for Jeans: [https://thor.dosomething.org/us/node/1144/edit](https://thor.dosomething.org/us/node/1144/edit)
   * Campaign ID: `1144`
   * This is the number you put in the Legacy ID field
8. In the right, you can see that your campaign is in Draft mode:
   * As you work, Contentful will save automatically for you. You can see when it was last saved under the "Publish" button. Make sure it's saved and then you can leave the page!
9. If this is supposed to be a legacy campaign, make sure the checkbox for the legacy campaign is checked. Otherwise, the default is mosaic.
10. Right now, the differences between legacy and mosaic campaigns are
    * Lede banner

# Goals

The goal of **Phoenix** is to provide the tools for campaign leads to create more engaging, useful and impactful campaigns.

In **Phoenix**, the campaign revolves around a community tab that displays updates in a reverse chronological order. We want to change the structure of the campaign be primarily community focused, with a feed that displays update messaging from the campaign leader and content from other members involved. We can structure the feed for whatever the demands of the campaign are––showcasing members, partners, CTAs, updates from the campaign leads, tips, and more.

The feed gives us a core loop to the product experience and a way to communicate the impact of the campaign back to users. It’s extensible as we develop new types of feed content and allows users see more content and examples of what involvement with a campaign looks like.

Nominally, we were creating a set of engagement points for users to remain in touch with the platform and content, but more importantly, we were creating an ecosystem for users to support each other. We want users to provide other members with positive feedback and foster a sense of community within a campaign that doesn’t require DoSomething staff to broker transactions.

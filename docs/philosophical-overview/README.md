# Philosophical Overview
***

The Philosophical Overview documentation functions as a companion to our technical documentation. Phoenix (next) is quite broad and powerful, so we have imposed strategies and limits to how the system will behave in order to provide the best experience for users, admins and engineers. As we make strategic and design related decisions, itâ€™s helpful to have written rationales and records. May the mistakes of the past never be repeated.

Some common questions you might answer with the philosophical system overview:
- Where do we show modals to users?
- What happens when a user signs up?
